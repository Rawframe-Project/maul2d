# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before
1.0.0, any minor release may change the API, the ABI and the
snapshot and journal formats.

## [Unreleased]

Work toward 0.0.1, the first release of the reworked library.

### Added

- `m2Counters.pairOverflow`: body pairs dropped by the last pair
  update because the pair table was full. Dropping pairs used to be a
  debug-only assert.
- `bench/`: benchmark scenes that time Maul2D and pin their final
  world hashes in `bench/pins.txt`. CI fails when a pin moves.
- `MAUL2D_BUILD_SHARED` builds a shared library. Public functions
  carry the `M2_API` export macro and everything else is hidden.
- `test/hashes.txt` holds the expected determinism hashes, and
  `tools/check_hashes.py` compares a test run with them, so a change
  that moves a hash the same way on every platform is caught too.

### Changed

- The version history restarts at 0.0.1. Earlier numbered releases
  were withdrawn.
- Refusing a caller's input no longer asserts in debug builds.
  `M2_ASSERT` is kept for internal invariants; every refusal instead
  records its reason for `m2LastResult` and, for a stale or wrong-kind
  id, counts in `m2Counters.misuse`.
- The CMake options follow one family scheme: `MAUL2D_BUILD_TESTS`,
  `_BUILD_SAMPLES`, `_BUILD_BENCH`, `_BUILD_TOOLS`, `_BUILD_TESTBED`,
  `_BUILD_SHARED`, `_INSTALL`, `_WERROR`, `_SANITIZE`, `_TSAN` and
  `_COVERAGE`. Tests, samples, benchmarks and tools default to on only
  when the project is built on its own, not when it is added with
  `add_subdirectory`.
- Warnings are errors only with `MAUL2D_WERROR=ON` (CI turns it on),
  so a newer compiler no longer breaks a consumer's build.
- The CMake modules in `cmake/`, the package config template and the
  pkg-config template are shared with the sibling engine. The pkg-
  config file is relocatable and no longer lists a thread library the
  engine does not use.
- Every test suite uses the shared `test/test_harness.h` instead of
  its own copy of the check macro.

### Removed

- `m2SetLastResult` from the public header. It was internal.
- The dual-backend harness and the `MAUL2D_BENCHMARKS` option, along
  with the performance comparison in the README that relied on them.

### Fixed

- The broadphase checked every candidate pair against every joint in
  the world to decide whether jointed bodies may collide. Each body
  now keeps a list of its joints, so the check costs the body's joint
  count. A 2000-link revolute chain steps 2.2 times faster, and
  `m2Body_GetJoints` and body destruction no longer scan all joints.
- Queries documented as safe to call from many threads at once shared
  one world-owned scratch buffer, so concurrent readers could corrupt
  each other's results. Tree walks now run on a cursor that lives on
  the caller's stack, and overlap queries keep their sorted results
  directly in the caller's array. A four-thread reader test covers it.
- `m2World_CastRayAll` and `m2World_CastCircleAll` silently kept at
  most 64 hits even when the caller's array was larger. They now keep
  as many as the array holds.
- Journal replay is now atomic: a tape that fails part way, whether
  truncated, corrupt or recreating an object under a different id than
  the recording saw, is refused and the world is rolled back to where
  it was. An id mismatch used to be a debug-only assert, so release
  builds replayed onward into a different world.
- `m2World_Restore` refuses a snapshot whose header counters point
  outside the world's capacities before overwriting anything, instead
  of indexing past the arrays afterwards.
- A moving shape met at most 256 others per tree in the broadphase and
  silently ignored the rest. The tree walk now has no fixed limit.
- When both shapes of a pair moved, the pair was collected twice
  before duplicates were removed, so a nearly full pair table could
  drop pairs that fit. Each such pair is now recorded once.
- The pair merge wrote its output into the top of the same buffer it
  was still reading candidates from. With a nearly full table it could
  overwrite unread keys. It now merges into a buffer of its own.
- `m2LastResult` was set by only a handful of refusals and lived in
  one process-wide slot. Every refusal now records its reason (invalid
  input, full pool or allocation failure, unsupported CPU) and the
  slot is per thread.
- The misuse counter was incremented without synchronization from
  reader-class calls, a data race when readers run in parallel. It is
  now updated atomically.
- The generated API reference merged declarations that followed a
  trailing comment into the previous entry, so it listed 276 functions
  where the headers declare 289. `tools/gen_api.py` now parses each
  declaration on its own and is shared with Maul3D.
- Input checks that tested `x == x` let infinities through. They now
  use finite checks, so infinite positions, velocities and parameters
  are refused like NaN.

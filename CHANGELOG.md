# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before
1.0.0, any minor release may change the API, the ABI and the
snapshot and journal formats.

## [Unreleased]

Work toward 0.0.1, the first release of the reworked library.

### Changed

- The version history restarts at 0.0.1. Earlier numbered releases
  were withdrawn.

### Fixed

- The broadphase checked every candidate pair against every joint in
  the world to decide whether jointed bodies may collide. Each body
  now keeps a list of its joints, so the check costs the body's joint
  count. A 2000-link revolute chain steps 2.2 times faster, and
  `m2Body_GetJoints` and body destruction no longer scan all joints.

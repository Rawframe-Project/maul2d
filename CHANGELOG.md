# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before
1.0.0, any minor release may change the API, the ABI and the
snapshot and journal formats.

## [Unreleased]

Work toward 0.0.1, the first release of the reworked library.

### Added

- `m2Counters.pairOverflow`: body pairs dropped by the last pair
  update because the pair table was full. Dropping pairs used to be a
  debug-only assert.

### Changed

- The version history restarts at 0.0.1. Earlier numbered releases
  were withdrawn.

### Fixed

- The broadphase checked every candidate pair against every joint in
  the world to decide whether jointed bodies may collide. Each body
  now keeps a list of its joints, so the check costs the body's joint
  count. A 2000-link revolute chain steps 2.2 times faster, and
  `m2Body_GetJoints` and body destruction no longer scan all joints.
- Queries documented as safe to call from many threads at once shared
  one world-owned scratch buffer, so concurrent readers could corrupt
  each other's results. Tree walks now run on a cursor that lives on
  the caller's stack, and overlap queries keep their sorted results
  directly in the caller's array. A four-thread reader test covers it.
- `m2World_CastRayAll` and `m2World_CastCircleAll` silently kept at
  most 64 hits even when the caller's array was larger. They now keep
  as many as the array holds.
- Journal replay is now atomic: a tape that fails part way, whether
  truncated, corrupt or recreating an object under a different id than
  the recording saw, is refused and the world is rolled back to where
  it was. An id mismatch used to be a debug-only assert, so release
  builds replayed onward into a different world.
- `m2World_Restore` refuses a snapshot whose header counters point
  outside the world's capacities before overwriting anything, instead
  of indexing past the arrays afterwards.
- A moving shape met at most 256 others per tree in the broadphase and
  silently ignored the rest. The tree walk now has no fixed limit.
- When both shapes of a pair moved, the pair was collected twice
  before duplicates were removed, so a nearly full pair table could
  drop pairs that fit. Each such pair is now recorded once.
- The pair merge wrote its output into the top of the same buffer it
  was still reading candidates from. With a nearly full table it could
  overwrite unread keys. It now merges into a buffer of its own.
